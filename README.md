# IntelliFit: An AI Powered Fitness Companion

## Desciption

Intellifitâ€™s AI-driven performance evaluation and correction system provides professional-grade workout assistance by leveraging deep learning, pose estimation, and motion analysis. Using real-time video input from a camera, it employs frameworks like MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect key skeletal landmarks, analyzing them against an extensive database of ideal exercise forms. This allows Intellifit to identify deviations in posture, joint angles, or balance and deliver instant corrective feedback through visual, auditory, or haptic alerts.

Beyond form correction, Intellifit tracks performance metrics such as range of motion, speed, and consistency, offering personalized recommendations based on fitness levels and goals. By ensuring proper execution, minimizing injury risks, and adapting to user progress, Intellifit transforms workouts into safe, efficient, and results-driven experiences with real-time, AI-powered precision.

## Technologies Used

- MediaPipe:  Used for real-time pose estimation that will be used to detect and track body keypoints during exercise.
- OpenCV: Used for video capture, image processing, and enhancement of the pose detection system. It handles real-time video input from cameras or video files.
- TensorFlow: Used for analyzing and classifying exercise movements based on pose data. It will be used to train models that detect and evaluate posture, form, and exercise correctness.
- NumPy: Used for numerical computations realted to body posture.
- Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the analysis results, such as exercise performance metrics, body movements, and real-time feedback
